You will get two seperate tree if remove any edge of tree. Adding a edge between any two edge would combime these tree and generate a tree because number of edges in tree is number of vertex - 1 and vice versa.

Now, To maximize diameter of new combimed tree, you should connect any point consisting the diameter of tree A and any point consisting the other tree. Therefore the maximum diameter of combined tree of two trees is sum of added edge plus diameters of two trees.
